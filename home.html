        <p id="description">
            Website development is the comprehensive process of building, coding, and maintaining websites or web applications, blending creative <br>design (look/feel/UX) with technical implementation (functionality/databases/security) using languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br>and frameworks, resulting in functional, accessible online platforms for users. It covers planning, designing, coding (front-end/back-end/full-stack), <br>testing, and launching, ensuring sites work across devices and meet business goals.
